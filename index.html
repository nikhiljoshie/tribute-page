            <ul class="font">
                <li>
                    <strong>1955</strong> - Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955 in San Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. He grew up
                    with his sister, Patty. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1969</strong> - Steve Jobs was offered a summer job at Hewlett-Peckard Co. by William Hewlett.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1972</strong> - After graduating from Homestead High School, Los Altos in 1972, Steve Jobs attended Reed College in Portland, Oregon for
                    two years. He dropped out after one semester to visit India and study eastern religions in the summer of 1974.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1975</strong> - In 1975, Steve Jobs joined a group known as the Homebrew Computer Club. One member, a technical whiz named Steve Wozniak,
                    was trying to build a computer. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak attended meetings of the Homebrew Computer Club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to
                    the development and marketing of the first Apple computer
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1976</strong> - In 1976, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak formed their own company. They called it Apple Computer Company, in memory of a happy
                    summer Steve Jobs had spent picking apples. They raised $1,300 in startup money by selling Steve Jobs' microbus and Steve Wozniak's calculator.
                    Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak launch Apple I for $666.66, the first single-board computer with a video interface and an onboard Read Only Memory
                    (ROM), which instructed the machine on how to load programs from an external source.

                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1984</strong> - In 1984, Apple introduced a revolutionary new model, the Macintosh. The on-screen display had small pictures called icons.
                    To use the computer, the user printed at an icon and clicked a button using a new device called a mouse. This process made the Macintosh very easy
                    to use. The Macintosh did not sell well to businesses, however. It lacked features other personal computers had, such as a corresponding high
                    quality printer.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1985</strong> - The failure of Macintosh signaled the beginning of Steve Jobs' downfall at Apple. Steve Jobs resigned in 1985 from the
                    company he had helped found, though he retained his title as Chairman of its board of directors. Steve Jobs soon hired some of his former employees
                    to begin a new computer company called NeXT.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1986</strong> - In 1986, Steve Jobs purchased a small company called Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas for less than $10 million. Pixar
                    specialized in computer animation.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1988</strong> - Late in 1988, the NeXT computer was introduced at a large Gala event in San Francisco, aimed at educational market. Initial
                    reactions were generally good. The product was user-friendly, and had a fast processing speed, excellent graphics displays, and an outstanding
                    sound system. Despite the warm reception, however, the NeXT machine never caught on. It was too costly, had a black & white screen, and could not
                    be linked to other computers or run common software.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1995</strong> - Pixar released Toy Story, a huge box office hit. Pixar later went on to make Toy Story 2 & A Bug's Life, which Disney
                    distributed, and Monsters, Inc. All these films have been extremely successful. Pixar's "Toy Story" was the highest grossing film that year.
                    Monsters, Inc. had the largest opening weekend ticket sales of any animated film in history.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>
                    <strong>1996</strong> - In a February 1996 TIME magazine article, Steve Jobs said, "The thing that drives me and my colleagues... is that you see
                    something very compelling to you, and you don't quite know how to get it, but you know, sometimes intuitively, it's within your grasp. And it's
                    worth putting in years of your life to make it come into existence". Jobs had worked hard to translate his ideas into exciting and innovative
                    products for business and consumers. He was instrumental in launching the age of the personal computer. Steve Jobs is truly a computer industry
                    visionary.

                    <br>
                    In December of 1996, Apple purchased NeXT Software for $427 million in cash and Apple stocks. Steve Jobs returned to Apple as an advisor to Apple
                    Chairman Gilbert F. Amelio. The following year, in a surprising event, Apple entered into a partnership with its
                    competitor Microsoft. The two companies, according to the New York Times, "agreed to cooperate on several sales and technology fronts". Over the
                    next six years, Apple introduced several new products and strategies.

                <li>
                    <strong>1997</strong> - In November 1997, Steve Jobs announced Apple would sell computers directly to users over the Internet and by telephone. The
                    Apple Store became a runway success. Within a week, it was the third largest e-commerce site on the Internet. In September of 1997, Steve Jobs was
                    named an interim CEO of Apple and Chairman of Apple Computer Inc., after Gilbert F. Amelio was ousted. Jobs' salary is $1.

                <li>
                    <strong>1998</strong> - In 1998, Steve Jobs announced the release of the iMac, which featured powerful computing at an affordable price. Apple
                    releases the all-in-one iMac computer, which sells a million of units, financially reviving the company and boosting its share price by 400
                    percent. The iMac computer wins the Gold Award from British Design and Art Direction. Vogue calls the iMac "one of Spring's hottest fashion
                    statements", and Business Week says it is "one of the century's lasting images". Steve Jobs wins a Chrysler Design Institute award for the iMac
                    design.

                    <strong>1999</strong> - The iBook was unveiled in July 1999. This is a clam-shaped laptop that is available in bright colors. It includes Apple's
                    Airport, a computer version of the cordless phone that would allow the user to surf the Internet wirelessly.
                </li>
                <br>

                    Jobs died at his Palo Alto, California home around 3 p.m. (PDT) on October 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of
                    his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, which resulted in respiratory arrest. He had lost consciousness the day before
                    and died with his wife, children and, sisters at his side. His sister, Mona Simpson, described his death thus: "Steve's final words, hours earlier,
                    were monosyllables, repeated three times. Before embarking, he'd looked at his sister Patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life
                    partner, Laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. Steve's final words were: 'Oh wow. Oh wow. Oh wow.'". He then lost consciousness and
                    died several hours later. A small private funeral was held on October 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for Steve Jobs' family, were
                    not made public.
